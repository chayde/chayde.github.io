Welcome! My name is Mark Riggs (aka Chayde), I'm a fourty something nerd interested in networking, cloud infrastructure, homelab/selfhosting and all sorts of various gaming topics. 

The site you've found is intended to be a repository for my notes and  documentation generated while working on various homelab projects. You may however also stumble upon posts about other [topics](/_posts/2022-08-14-homemade-pastrami.md) as well .
