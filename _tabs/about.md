# About

Welcome! My name is Mark Riggs (aka Chayde), I'm a fourty something nerd interested in networking, cloud infrastructure, homelab/selfhosting and all sorts of various gaming topics. 

The site you've found is intended to be a repository for not only documentation I generate for my various homelab projects but any other topics I find interesting enough to write about I intend to capture those here as well.
